## Aurora Late Night Venue

## Overview

Theme of the project was selected by me to avoid being similar with other students.
A responsive website for a Late Night Venue based in Westport, Co. Mayo, Ireland.
Please note that this venue doesn't exist, it was made up for project with Code Institute.
Website features a home page with location, drinks menu, opening times and social links, contact page and a gallery. 
The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers to making first contact with the venue by giving all necessary information, bring potential and existing costumers back to property by showing latest images from property and a contact page that will bring aditional sales. 

### What is this website for?

For the buissness:
* To bring potential and existing costumers back to property.
* Provide high quality examples that costumers enjoy the venue.
* Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) that will then lead to reservations for celebrations and other occasions which will generate future sales. 
* Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to fill out the contact form and make people advertise venue by "mouth to mouth" method.

For the customers:
* Find the location of the venue. 
* Easily find a way to get in touch with the venue.
* Find out what are opening hours.
* Easily get in contact with the venue for reservtions and special accomodations.

The ideal client for this business is:
* Minimum age of 18.
* Has disposable income.
* Speaks english (Native or as a second language).
