## Features

Each page features a responsive navigation bar with conventional placing of logo and a navigation bar in the top right.
Each page has a footer with copyright information and social media icons linking to respective social media pages. 

##### Home

The Home page features a hero image. On mobile and tablet devices a full screen static image is seen. 
After the special hero image there is a location, drinks menu and opening times.

##### Gallery

The Gallery page is laid out in grid sistem. 3 to 4 images on desktop, 2 to 1 for tablets and 1 image per column for mobile devices'
Each image is b

Note: The design choice for 2 columns wide gallery preview on mobile is to encourage users to click the thumbnail and view the image in full. 
Viewing the images in full is much preferred by the artist to looking at images restricted by margins and padding. The thumbnails are still large enough to be easily clickable on mobile. 

Each can be clicked to open a **fancybox** window to view the artwork in detail, 
to move on to the next image, view the previous one, or return to the gallery page.

At the bottom of the gallery page the user is guided to choose from two **call to action buttons**: To view *Pricing* or learn *How to Order*. Again, the How to Order button is highlighted.


##### Contact

The Contact page features a **contact form**, which requests client name and email, and below that a box to leave a message. 

The bottom of the form contains a **Send Button**

### A note to my fellow Code Institute students

I am happy that you have come to look at my readme as an example of how to write a good one for your first Milestone project. 
You are welcome to learn how to structure and format your own readme from mine. 

However, it is not ok to copy and paste large portions of it into your own project. 
Please remember to write your own readme yourself, rather than copying mine or someone elses. 

Many thanks! Anna
